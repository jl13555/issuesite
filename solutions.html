  						Columbia University and NYU researchers caution about an impending "office real estate apocalypse" as remote work persists post-COVID-19. To address this, the city ought to implement a tax relief initiative to incentivize building owners to repurpose offices into residential spaces. For example, the program could offer a 14-year plan of tax breaks and waivers for developments allocating a minimum of 20 percent of units to low-income residents.

  						Outside of Manhattan, two million housing units are accessible on foot from a subway station. However, current zoning laws limit them mostly to single family to three family residences. The city should consider loosening these regulations, permitting denser development near subway or rail stops.

  					<p>
  						Recently, rezoning requests, particularly in wealthier neighborhoods, have lead to significant down-zoning, leading to a decrease in available housing. A data-driven approach to combat this trend would be to evaluate metrics such as housing cost burdens for both homeowners and renters, using the results to trigger zoning upgrades in areas experiencing a clear shortage and strong demand.
